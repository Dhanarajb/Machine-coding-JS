# Machine-Coding Challenges in JavaScript

### 1. Chain Calculator
- Implement a calculator that supports method chaining for basic arithmetic operations.

### 2. Execute Promises in Sequence
- Execute an array of promises one after the other in a sequence.

### 3. Pipe and Compose Functions
- Implement `pipe` and `compose` utility functions to handle function composition.

### 4. Custom Array Polyfills
- Create polyfills for the following array methods:
  - `map()`
  - `filter()`
  - `reduce()`
  - `forEach()`
  - `find()`
  - `some()`
  - `every()`

### 5. Prototype and Prototype Inheritance
- Demonstrate JavaScript prototypes and how to achieve inheritance using prototypes.

### 6. Call, Apply, and Bind
- Implement custom versions of `call()`, `apply()`, and `bind()` methods.

### 7. Flatten a Nested Array
- Write a function to flatten a deeply nested array (e.g., `[[1, [2, [3, [4]]]]]`).

### 8. Basic Debouncing
- Implement a debouncing function to limit how often a function executes.

### 9. Basic Throttling
- Implement a throttling function to control the rate of function execution.

### 10. Event Emitter
- Build an event emitter with methods like `on`, `off`, `emit`, and `once`.

### 11. Debouncing with Leading and Trailing Calls
- Extend debouncing functionality to include leading and trailing edge calls.

### 12. MapLimit Functionality
- Implement `mapLimit` to process an array of items with a limit on concurrent executions.

### 13. Cancelable Promise
- Create a promise that can be canceled before it resolves.

### 14. Typeahead Search Using LRU Cache
- Build a typeahead search feature with an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache for optimization.

### 15. Compare Two Documents for Differences
- Write a function to compare two JSON-like documents and identify differences.

### 16. Currying
- Implement a function to support currying (e.g., `sum(1)(2)(3)`).

### 17. Execute Tasks in Parallel
- Execute an array of asynchronous tasks in parallel and gather the results.

### 18. Find Matching DOM Element
- Write a function to find a matching element in the DOM tree based on specific criteria.

### 19. Array Sorting
- Implement sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort).

### 20. Flatten a Complex Object
- Flatten a deeply nested object into a single-level object.

### 21. Dispatch Custom Event on Array Push
- Extend the `Array.prototype.push` method to dispatch a custom event when invoked.

### 22. Deep Clone of an Object
- Write a utility to perform a deep clone of a JavaScript object.

### 23. Serialize Data Using `JSON.stringify`
- Serialize data with custom handling for special cases (e.g., circular references).

### 24. React DOM Rendering Process
- Explain and demonstrate how React renders and updates the DOM.

### 25. Retry Promise N Times on Failure
- Implement a function to retry a promise-based operation up to `N` times on failure.

### 26. Extend Event Emitter
- Add additional functionality to an event emitter (e.g., event priority or context).

### 27. Promise.all Implementation
- Write a custom implementation of `Promise.all`.

### 28. Promise.race Implementation
- Write a custom implementation of `Promise.race`.

### 29. Promise.any Implementation
- Write a custom implementation of `Promise.any`.

### 30. Promise.allSettled Implementation
- Write a custom implementation of `Promise.allSettled`.
